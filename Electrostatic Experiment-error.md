<div style="width:82px;float:left;line-height:16pt"><b>Abstract: </b></div> 
<div style="overflow:hidden;line-height:16pt">The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the fundamental principles of electrostatics, specifically the methods of charging objects by friction, contact, and induction, and to verify the law of conservation of charge. Using a Faraday Ice Pail and a Wireless Charge Sensor, I measured the electric potential generated by charged disks under various conditions. The results from the friction experiment demonstrated that rubbing two neutral materials generates equal and opposite charges, with the sum of the charges remaining near zero, validating the conservation of charge. Experiments on contact charging showed that touching a conductor transfers charge of the same sign, while induction charging demonstrated that grounding a conductor in the presence of a charged object creates a charge of the opposite sign.</div>

## Introduction

Electrostatics is the study of stationary electric charges. Central to this experiment is the concept that charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred—the Law of Conservation of Charge. $\Delta Q_{\text{total}}=0$.

### Objective

The primary objective is to use a Faraday Ice Pail to investigate three distinct methods of charging: friction, conduction, and induction.

### Physical Principles

The experiment relies on the Faraday Ice Pail, a conductive mesh cylinder electrically isolated from a grounded outer shield. When a charged object is placed inside the pail without touching it, an equal magnitude of charge is induced on the inner surface of the pail, while a charge of the same sign as the object is driven to the outer surface (and the connected sensor).

The voltage $V$ measured by the sensor is directly proportional to the charge $Q$ on the pail, according to the relation $Q = CV$, where $C$ is the capacitance of the system. Therefore, voltage readings serve as a direct proxy for the magnitude and polarity of the charge.

- **Charging by Friction:** When two different materials are rubbed together, electrons are transferred from one to the other based on their electron affinity (triboelectric series). If the system is isolated, the net charge remains constant: $\sum Q_{initial} = \sum Q_{final}$.
- **Charging by Contact:** Touching a charged object to a conductor transfers charge directly. The conductor acquires the same sign of charge as the object.
- **Charging by Induction:** Bringing a charged object near a conductor causes charge separation. If the conductor is momentarily grounded, charges of the same sign are repelled to the ground, leaving the conductor with a net charge opposite to that of the external object.

## Procedures and Methods

### Apparatus

The experimental setup included a PASCO Faraday Ice Pail, a Wireless Charge Sensor connected via a clip cable, and charge producers (white and blue disks).

### Experimental Procedure

#### Setup and Grounding

The charge sensor was connected to the pail (red clip) and the shield (black clip). Before each trial, the system was grounded by touching both the pail and the shield simultaneously to remove residual charge, and the sensor was zeroed in the Capstone software. The setup and grounding process are shown in Figure 1, 2.

## Discussions

### Analysis of Charging by Friction

In Trial 1a (Table 1), the system started with zero net charge (Initial: 0.003 V). After rubbing and separating the disks inside the pail (Row 3), the voltage remained effectively zero (0.001 V), indicating that no net charge was created. When the blue disk was removed (Row 4), the pail measured the white disk's charge as **+0.349 V**. When the white disk was removed (Row 6), the pail measured the blue disk's charge as **-0.335 V**. The sum of these charges is $0.349 + (-0.335) = 0.014 \text{ V}$​, which is very close to zero. Generally, Sum of rows 4 and 6 for 1a, 1b, 1c are close to zero.

This confirms the **Law of Conservation of Charge**: the positive charge gained by the white disk is equal in magnitude to the negative charge gained by the blue disk. 

***Finding:*** The White Charge Producer becomes positively charged, and the Blue Charge Producer becomes negatively charged.

### Analysis of Charging by Contact

In Experiment 2 (Table 2), I verified that contact transfers charge of the same polarity.

- **Trial 2a:** The white disk (positive) touched the pail. The final reading "Disk out" was **0.206 V** (positive).
- **Trial 2b:** The blue disk (negative) touched the pail. The final reading "Disk out" was **-0.128 V** (negative). This confirms that conduction transfers the specific charge of the object to the conductor.

### Analysis of Charging by Induction

In Experiment 3 (Table 3), I utilized the principle of grounding to induce an opposite charge.

- **Trial 3a:** The white disk (positive, indicated by Initial +0.152 V) was inserted. The pail was grounded (reading goes to ~0 V). Upon removing the positive disk, the pail retained a **negative charge** (-0.152 V).
- **Trial 3b:** The blue disk (negative, indicated by Initial -0.290 V) was inserted. After grounding and removal, the pail retained a **positive charge** (+0.248 V). This demonstrates that charging by induction produces a charge on the conductor opposite to that of the inducing object. Interestingly, the magnitude of the induced charge (e.g., |-0.152|) was nearly identical to the initial detected charge (+0.152), suggesting a highly efficient induction process in the Faraday pail setup.

### Sources of Error

- **Leakage Currents:** Charge can leak through moisture in the air or imperfect insulation, causing voltage drift over time.
- **Stray Charges:** The experimenter’s body or clothes may carry static charge, affecting the sensitive readings if they move too close to the pail.
- **Sensor Drift:** The "After grounding" values in Table 3 (e.g., -0.053 V for Trial 3b) suggest the sensor or grounding connection might not have been perfect, or the zero point drifted slightly.

## Conclusion

This experiment successfully demonstrated the fundamental behavior of static electricity. I confirmed the conservation of charge by showing that friction generates equal and opposite charges on two neutral bodies (white became positive, blue became negative). We further validated that charging by contact results in the same charge polarity, while charging by induction results in the opposite polarity. The experimental data closely aligned with theoretical expectations, providing clear empirical evidence for the behavior of electric charges in conductors and insulators.
